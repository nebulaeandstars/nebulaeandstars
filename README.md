# Hey!

I'm a music/science student at the Australian National University. I tend to make a lot of puzzles and shell scripts, but also maintain my own forks of `st`, `dwm`, and `dmenu` from [suckless.org](https://suckless.org). This is my personal account, so you can also find my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nebulaeandstars/dotfiles) here.

Here are my stats:

I'm familiar with:
- bash
- rust
- c++
- python
- javascript (inc. gatsby/react)
- ARMv7 + Thumb2 Unified Assembly

C is over-represented here, and rust is severely under-represented, but here is a breakdown of what currently sits in my repositories:
