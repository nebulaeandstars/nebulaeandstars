# Hey!

I'm a music/science student at the Australian National University. Outside of work, I tend to make a lot of puzzles and shell scripts, but I've also made a few vim extensions. This is my personal account, so you can find my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nebulaeandstars/dotfiles) here, as well as my own personal forks of `st`, `dwm`, and `dmenu` from [suckless.org](https://suckless.org).

Here are my stats:

- c
- rust
- java
- bash
- python
- ARMv7 + Thumb2 unified assembly
